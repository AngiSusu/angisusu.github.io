        <p id="aboutme">did you know that statistically, women apologize more often than men do? according to a 2010 study in the us journal psychological science, women offer more apologies and believe they commit more offenses than men. <br/><br/>

        women often downplay their successes and lose confidence for the sake of "being polite." and rather alarmingly, women who don't play by the rules are frequently labeled "bossy" or "conceited," whereas men would be labeled as "leaders." in an already incredibly underrepresented field, women in tech encounter obstacle after obstacle when trying to claim a seat at the table. <br/><br/>

        empoWOMENt is a messaging tool that not only detects phrases that show a lack of confidence but also suggests alternative ways to express ideas. by dropping unnecessary apologies and using clear and direct language, women will become more comfortable, confident, and proud when sharing ideas. and by changing the way women think about themselves, we can break the glass ceiling! achieving women's equality isn't easy, but it starts from the grassroots.</p><br/>

                <p>this little guy only wants to talk about one thing: chinese snacks! dimsum, which literally translates to "snack" in chinese, is a family-style mini-meal usually eaten around brunch time. also, my first attempt at making a chatbot! starts out as a bot that is hard-programmed to respond to certain words. however, starting to use lemmatization and machine learning - with libraries like textblob and spacy! - to make this bot a little more intelligent.</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/AngiSusu/internboat">github</a>
                <p>made by an all-female team at hackgt v, was inspired by our fatigue after filling out the same information fields in endless internship applications. and hence, internboat was born! this website allows you to fill out a basic profile linkedin-style and then web scrapes any extra questions from company websites so you never have to go to another internship website and apply there again! internboat brings everything into one interface and makes applying easy and painless.</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/AngiSusu/open-invite">github</a>
                <p>made by me and one other friend at swamphacks iv. we made a social gathering app where you can create an event, and any users registered with open invite in a certain radius from your event will be able to see it and come join. the more the merrier - and bringing strangers together is a great way to socialize and make new friends. available on both web and mobile.</p>

                <p>the very first hackathon project i ever did! a very ambitious project for four first-years tackling the ar/vr trend. take a picture of text on your phone, highlight words, and this app will project a floating ar image of the word visualization on the screen! for example, highlighting the word "tree" will generate a floating picture of a tree. a bit buggy and messy overall but a great tool for teaching vocabulary or serving as a visual dictionary! android only.</p>
